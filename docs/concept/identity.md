# Identity

Decentralized digital identity is a core component of the Parmeus network. Your digital identity in Parmeus is self-sovereign and controlled by you: that means your digital identity is yours. You control how that ID is used and what data is connected with your ID. Your digital identity allows trusted data across the Parmeus network and across web3.

The way we interact with the web is changing. In the past, most web users relied on usernames and passwords (Identity 1.0) stored in centralized databases to connect with digital services. This was followed by Identity 2.0, where centralized companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter created "login with Our Company" to simplify login for users but also collect data about their activity and behavior across the web.

However, the next stage in this evolution is decentralized digital identities. We can look at the evolution of digital identity in three phases: 
• Identity 1.0: Centralized identity with a username and password. 
• Identity 2.0: Federated identity which uses identity-related data for commercial purposes. 
• Identity 3.0: Decentralized or self-sovereign identity which gives users control of their identity through identity wallets. 

Parmeus enables users to create and manage their own decentralized digital identity: their Digital Self.

Parmeus enables permissionless creation of digital identity and discovery and formation of connections between individuals and groups. Parmeus digital identity is portable, interoperable and chain agnostic. This identity develops a multifaceted representation of your identity and makes it portable across web3 chains and platforms. It connects your underlying traits, life data and soulbound tokens to your [Digital Self](https://parmeus.github.io/docs/#/concept/digital-self).

Then, your digital identity can be used to connect with other individuals and communities, and to provide opportunities to earn rewards based on activity and participation in the network.

At an abstract level, Parmeus Identity has the following characteristics:

1. **Build on the individual's innate characteristics.** This is the most important feature that distinguishes Parmeus ID from other Decentralized ID (DID) projects. Many projects are built on the visible contributions of individuals, custom reputation systems, and commitments, which are slightly superficial features. The Parmeus team have used their decades of experience in behavioral science to discover the underlying characteristics of individuals and provide a foundation for developers across web3.

2. **Progressive decentralization.** Parmeus embraces progressive decentralization, by gradually decentralization across the tech stack. Providing a decentralized solution for DID, Parmeus gives users full ownership and control of their data, allowing them to connect their data across multiple wallet addresses to create a comprehensive representation of their digital self. This approach allows for seamless integration across different dApps, protocols, and platforms, while providing users with the necessary tools to protect their privacy.

 The decentralization of the data layer allows users to control the data connected with the digital self, while allowing for the network to provide a comprehensive and accurate representation of their innate personal traits. This allows for greater transparency and control over one's digital identity, while still allowing for meaningful and personalized connections with other users and organizations within the network.

3. **Digital Selves and Soulbound tokens are the core component of Parmeus.** Digital wallets are the individual marker of digital identity and soulbound tokens built a mosaic to represent each individual's online identity. Then, everything that a user does in the Parmeus protocol to develop their digital self forms part of their identity in web3. Individuals are able to connect multiple wallet addresses to a single Parmeus ID, each of which contribute more to building up the full picture of the digital identity.

Soulbound tokens can then be used to link individual Selves to groups and organizations. For example, DAOs could be formed based on specific characteristics of digital selves - connecting like minded people or ensuring representation from a wide range of different characteristics. Soulbound tokens can represent membership of a group, specific achievements, awards or commendations. Token or NFT airdrops can be sent to anyone based on criteria linked to their digital selves.

4. **Verifiability. Verifiability is another crucial aspect of Parmeus.** The Parmeus Protocol enables any dApp to request and verify a user's Verifiable Credentials or specific attributes from one or more of their Soulbound traits. Verifiable information is important in creating a trustworthy digital ecosystem, and Parmeus Identity provides a secure and reliable way for users to prove their identity and credentials. With Parmeus, verifiability is a core feature that ensures the integrity of the digital identity system.
