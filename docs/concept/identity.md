# Identity

Parmeus is a decentralized identity protocol. It enables permissionless creation of digital identity and developing connections between individuals and groups. Parmeus digital identity is portable, interoperable and chain agnostic. This identity system relies on all the underlying trait capabilities, life data, and many soulbound properties possessed by each user's personally developed digital soul. At the same time, it aims to connect individuals with communities and allow users to earn rewards based on their activity and participation in the network.

At an abstract level, Parmeus Identity has the following characteristics:

1. **Build on the individual's personality, abilities, soft skills**. This is the most important feature that distinguishes Parmeus ID from other Decentralized ID (DID) projects. Many projects are built on the visible contributions of individuals, custom reputation systems, and commitments, which are slightly superficial features. Parmeus have used their decades of experience in behavioral analysis to discover the underlying characteristics of individuals and provide a foundation for developers across web3.
2. **Complete decentralization**. Parmeus enables users to have complete control over their own DID. Web2 identities are owned by centralized platform and users have little control over their own data and digital identities. With Parmeus ID, all data is decentralized, owned by the user in their Digital Soul. The data is portable and interoperable, so there are no barriers between different dapps, protocols or platforms. Digital souls can go anywhere without centralized barriers. 
3. **Digital Souls** and soulbound tokens are the core component of Parmeus. Souls are the individual marker of digital identity and soulbound tokens built a mosaic to represent each individualâ€™s soul. Then, everything that a user does in the Parmeus protocol to develop their digital soul forms part of their identity in web3. Individuals are able to connect multiple wallet addresses to a single Parmeus ID, each of which contribute more to building up the full picture of the digital soul.
Soulbound tokens can then be used to link individual Souls to groups and organizations. For example, DAOs could be formed based on specific characteristics of digital souls - connecting like minded people or ensuring representation from a wide range of different characteristics. Soulbound tokens can represent membership of a group, specific achievements, awards or commendations. Token or NFT airdrops can be sent to anyone based on criteria linked to their digital souls.
4. **Verifiability**. Through Parmeus Protocol, any dApp can request and verify a user's Verifiable Credentials or specific attributes from one or Soulbound traits.
