# Soulbound Token

Soulbound is a philosophy that Parmeus has implemented from start to finish. We have designed a complete digital soul growth path. During the process of playing, training, growing and unlocking achievements, you can gradually obtain your own soulbound badges; at the same time, users can also mint these badges as SBT according to their own wishes. We call it PSBT (short for Parmeus Soulbound Token). These PSBTs will serve as future passes to third-party projects.

Parmeus Soulbound System offers two types of PSBT.

1. SBT based on the growth of Digital Soul
2. SBT unlocked based on individual abilities and characteristics

## Digital Soul Growth PSBT

Digital Soul Growth PSBT is an oulbound Token that automatically upgrades as the user's digital soul grows.

Parmeus designed a variety of ways for users to explore while playing, and also completed the construction and training of digital souls. Users can accumulate Parmeus Points every time they play, share, and contribute to the community after completing specific tasks, similar to the experience points of RPG games. When the Parmeus Points reach a certain standard, the Digital Soul will be automatically upgraded. The higher the level, the more similar the user's Digital Soul is to himself. In the Parmeus ecosystem, the holders of the Digital Soul are more able to help themselves; for the community, it is easier to be trusted, there are more opportunities to contribute to the community, and at the same time, they can earn more benefits.

Here are some badges for example.

## Ability and Characteristic based PSBT

The footprints left by users in the Parmeus ecosystem, our machine learning model has been working, synchronously discovering your talents in psychology, occupation, psychology, financial quotient and other fields. Parmeus automatically issues a badge to the user when it finds that you meet a certain standard. This type of badge is valid for a period of time after it is obtained and will not change.

As an example, according to research published by bot detection tool Jigger, a large portion of Web3 activity is driven by bots, with GameFi projects receiving the most infections, with some [games](https://www.todayusstock.com/special_46.html) Robots account for more than 80% of its user base.

A useful PSBT provided by Parmeus is `Humanity`, which eliminates the risk of whether the account is a robot recently through user's recent decentralized behavior in the Parmeus ecosystem. It is cool to reach real users more effectively for the 3rd party projects and airdrop.

There are many more roles for PSBT, which are in development.
