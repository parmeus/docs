# Soulbound Token

Soulbound Tokens represent a non-transferable unit of information linked to a [Digital Self](https://parmeus.github.io/docs/#/concept/digital-self).

A Soulbound token is a type of non-fungible token (NFT) that is linked to an individual’s specific characteristics, traits, and achievements in the Parmeus ecosystem. It is used to build comprehensive and representative layers of data about individual and their behaviour and social relationships. 

Soulbound tokens are linked to the Digital Self and can be used to grant or share access to intellectual property, digital data, or other information resources, creating new economic opportunities in the ownership economy. The Parmeus network uses game-based general intelligence checks and sanity metrics to build a robust and scalable personhood check, ensuring that Soulbound tokens are linked to a real person with live on-chain verification.

Each user develops their Digital Self themselves in the process of playing games, connecting and collaborating with other Digital Selves, and participating in the network. This enables the network to connect each user with other activities to further develop their Digital Self, or with other like-minded Digital Selves. 

We are building the infrastructure for everyone  to create, cultivate and develop a Digital Self. During the process of playing, training, growing and unlocking achievements, you can gradually obtain your own tokens and assets that represent your unique characteristics and achievements. Users can mint Parmeus Soulbound Tokens (PSBTs) which will serve as keys to unlock access to other dApps, communities, DAOs and projects and other web3 applications.

Parmeus Discovery Protocol connects with a variety of data layers including:

1. Digital growth and achievement
2. Innate characteristics

## Digital Growth and achievement

The Parmeus Soulbound Token connects with a variety of metrics and assets that represent progress and achievements.

Parmeus designed a variety of ways for users to explore while playing and training their digital selves. Users accumulate Parmeus points every time they play, share, and contribute to the network and after completing specific tasks, similar to experience points in RPG games. When the Parmeus points reach a certain threshold, the Digital Growth will be automatically upgraded. The higher the level of growth connected to their Soulbound Token, the more accurate the user’s Digital Self is representative of their digital behavior. 

In the Parmeus ecosystem, higher levels of Digital Growth represent higher levels of participation in the network and greater levels of trust created by that Digital Self. This unlocks more opportunities to collect, collaborate and create within the network and across different communities to access greater benefits and earn more rewards.

Here are some examples of badges.

## Innate characteristics

The Parmeus ecosystem is designed to help users develop their skills and expertise in various fields, from psychology to art to technology. By analyzing user behavior and data, Parmeus can identify users with certain talents or achievements and issue them badges that reflect their skills.

For example, a user who demonstrates a high level of skill in a specific game or task might receive a badge that certifies their expertise in that area. Similarly, a user who contributes significantly to a DAO or community might receive a badge that reflects their contributions and leadership abilities.

Parmeus Soulbound Tokens (PSBTs) can also be used to verify a user's identity and prevent bot activity. For instance, a PSBT for Proof of Humanity can be used to ensure that an account is linked to a real person, while a PSBT for Proof of Ownership can be used to verify ownership of a particular asset.

As the Parmeus ecosystem grows and evolves, new use cases for PSBTs will emerge, allowing users to unlock new opportunities and achieve greater success in their chosen fields.
