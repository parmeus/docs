# Soulbound Token

Digital Souls and soulbound tokens are the core component of Parmeus. We have built the infrastructure for everyone  to create, cultivate and develop a Digital Soul. During the process of playing, training, growing and unlocking achievements, you can gradually obtain your own soulbound tokens that represent your unique characteristics and achievements. Users can mint Parmeus Soulbound Tokens (PSBTs) which will serve as keys to unlock access to other dapps, communities, DAOs and projects and other web3 applications.

Parmeus Soulbound Protocol offers two types of PSBT.

1. SBT based on the growth of Digital Soul
2. SBT based on individual abilities and characteristics

## Digital Soul Growth PSBT

The Digital Soul Growth PSBT is represented by a single Soulbound token that automatically upgrades as the user's digital soul develops.

Parmeus designed a variety of ways for users to explore while playing and training their digital souls. Users accumulate Parmeus points every time they play, share, and contribute to the network and after completing specific tasks, similar to experience points in RPG games. When the Parmeus points reach a certain threshold, the Digital Soul Growth PSBT will be automatically upgraded. The higher the level of Soul Growth PSBT, the more accurate the userâ€™s Digital Soul is representative of their digital behavior. 

In the Parmeus ecosystem, higher levels of Digital Soul Growth PSBT represent higher levels of participation in the network and greater levels of trust created by that Digital Soul. This unlocks more opportunities to collect, collaborate and create within the network and across different communities to access greater benefits and earn more rewards.

Here are some examples of badges.

## Ability and Characteristic based PSBT

By looking at the footprints left by users in the Parmeus ecosystem, our machine learning model works synchronously discovering your talents in psychology, business, financial matters, and other fields. Parmeus automatically issues a badge to the user when it finds that you meet a certain standard. This type of badge is valid for a period of time after it is obtained and will not change.

As an example, according to research published by bot detection tool Jigger, a large portion of Web3 activity is driven by bots, with GameFi projects receiving the most infections - in some games non-human players account for more than 80% of the user base.

A useful PSBT provided by Parmeus is Humanity, which judges the risk of whether the account is a robot by assessing a user's recent decentralized behavior in the Parmeus ecosystem. This is a great tool for 3rd party projects and airdrops who want to ensure they are reaching real users.
There are many more roles for PSBTs, which are in development.
