# Recommendation

Parmeus network is an information social network built around Digital Souls. A recommendation system is a critical component in building and expanding networks, adding value for users and creating connections. Through the similarity network map of Parmeus, we can easily and efficiently provide a variety of recommendation functions.

## People looking for people

People looking for people is the essence of the recommendation system. In the Parmeus ecosystem, users have their own unique Digital Soul. These Digital Souls are linked to soulbound tokens which represent their preferences, abilities, personalities, achievements and more. Through sophisticated machine learning Parmeus can connect users based on the similarity of these attributes.

Imagine that you want to talk to someone with the same musical preferences as you, likes the same sports, and is curious about new things. In the Parmeus network the stable underlying traits are built up through behavioral science games. Preferences and interests are built up through interaction, communication and participation in the network. The combination of information created and curated within Digital Souls connects people based on the characteristics that are most important to them.

## People looking for information

Some of the most useful information in a network are the attributes, preferences, experiences, commodity entities, of users. People use social information within their networks to make connections, create content, build new things and broaden their network.

Life Data is one of the core components of a Digital Soul. Users have complete control of their own Life Data, and can choose to keep all of their data completely private, or share it with selected connections, groups or organizations such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Users can build up their Life Data and utilize or share it however they choose.

For example, if a user finds a new favorite book, movie or song, they may want to add their favorites to their life data. They can use this information to find recommendations that are similar to their own preferences, or make connections based on those interests. 

For a highly advanced Soul, Parmeus network can make predictions across different categories based on interrelated preferences across the network. For example, recommending movies based on a personâ€™s music preferences, educational background and social connections.

## Searching for people by preferences

This is the reverse lookup of "people looking for information". Find or generate networks of people based on key information criteria, sets of preferences or information filters. For example, find groups of people who like a specific genre of movie and a specific genre of music. Or people who studied a particular topic in college and are fans of a specific author or musician. The possibilities are endless.

## Looking for things by things

Specify a general "thing" to find the related "other thing". For example, if I bought a TV and wanted to see if any of the peripherals were missing. Here, I can find people who are similar to me and have also bought this brand of TV. Recommendations about what they have purchased before and after, and knowledge of any issues they had would be very useful.
