# Recommendation

Parmeus is a social network built by Digital Soul. Recommendation System is one of the essential functions in a social network. Through the similarity network map of Parmeus, we can easily and efficiently provide the following recommendation functions.

## People looking for people

People looking for people is the essence of the whole recommendation system. In the Parmeus ecosystem, users have their own unique and special digital soul. These digital souls have unique preferences, abilities, personalities, etc. Through unique machine learning, Parmeus can quickly find other people who are most similar to you in the ecology for more interactions.

Let's imagine that you want to talk to someone who has the same musical preferences as you, likes sports, and is curious about new things. It's hard in real life because it takes long-term interaction, communication, discovery to find similar people. In the Parmeus world, the stable underlying traits and preferences discovered through behavioral science games cannot be disguised; and the long-term connection bonus established between digital souls can quickly help you filter out the people you want.

## People looking for things

The "things" here generally refer to useful information, such as preferences, experiences, commodity entities, etc. With the nature of people looking for people, people looking for things will become a matter of course. When we introduced Digital Soul earlier, we mentioned that Life Data is one of the necessary components of Digital Soul. Users can selectively open Life Data to everyone, relatives and friends, or not open Life Data through the access authorization control of their own data. On the basis of finding similar groups, a secondary filter on Life Data can get very useful information.

For example, when I finish reading a book, I like it very much, and I want to see what other well-reviewed books have been read by people similar to me. Paremus can help very well.

Parmeus will also gradually learn more fields, and collect and classify popular things to make up for recommendations that Life Data alone cannot provide.

## Looking for people by things

This is the reverse lookup of "people looking for things". For example, I recently read a book and wanted to find this group. After filtering through some other conditions, it would be a very wonderful experience to chat with these people.

## Looking for things by things

Through a general "thing", find the related "other thing". Like I bought a TV to see if any of the TV peripherals were missing. Here, you can find people who are similar to me and have also bought this brand of TV. Recommendations about what they have purchased before and after purchase will be a very good suggestion.
