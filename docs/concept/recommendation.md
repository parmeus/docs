# Recommendation

A recommendation engine is an essential part of the Parmeus network as it helps users to discover new content, activities, and other Digital Selves that align with their interests and innate characteristics. Parmeus uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and user behavior data to generate personalized recommendations for each user. The recommendation engine analyzes their activity within the network to create a comprehensive understanding of their preferences and traits.

The recommendation system is a critical component in building and expanding networks, adding value for users and creating connections. Through the similarity network map of Parmeus, we can easily and efficiently provide a variety of recommendation functions.

## People looking for people

People looking for people is the essence of the recommendation system. In the Parmeus ecosystem, users have their own unique Digital Self linked to a Soulbound tokens which represents their preferences, abilities, personalities, achievements and more. Through sophisticated machine learning Parmeus can connect users based on the similarity of these attributes.

Imagine that you want to talk to someone with the same musical preferences as you, likes the same sports, and is curious about new things. In the Parmeus network the stable underlying traits are built up through behavioral science games. Preferences and interests are built up through interaction, communication and participation in the network. The combination of information created and curated from network data connects people based on the characteristics that are most important to them.

## People looking for information

Some of the most useful information in a network are the attributes, preferences, experiences and behavior of users. People use social information within their networks to make connections, create content, build new things and broaden their network.

Life Data is one of the core components of a Digital Self. Users have complete control of their own Life Data, and can choose to keep all of their data completely private, or share it with selected connections, groups or organizations such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Users can build up their Life Data and utilize or share it however they choose.

For example, if a user finds a new favorite book, movie or song, they may want to add their favorites to their life data. They can also import their data from various web2 platforms to help Parmeus automatically integrate their life data into their Digital Self. Then they can use this enhancement to find recommendations that are similar to their own preferences, or make connections based on those interests. 

For a highly developed Digital Self, Parmeus network can make predictions across different categories based on interrelated preferences across the network. For example, recommending movies based on a personâ€™s music preferences, educational background and social connections.

## Searching for people by preferences

This is the reverse lookup of "people looking for information". Find or generate networks of people based on key information criteria, sets of preferences or information filters. For example, find groups of people who like a specific genre of movie and a specific genre of music. Or people who studied a particular topic in college and are fans of a specific author or musician. The possibilities are endless.

## Looking for things by things

Users can use the search prototype feature to find related things or experiences by leveraging the similarity-based network of Digital Selves. For example, if a user has recently purchased a TV and is looking for peripherals or accessories, they can use the search function to find other users who have also purchased the same brand of TV and see what peripherals they have bought. Through this process, users can obtain recommendations on what others have purchased before and after, as well as learn about any issues they had with their purchases
