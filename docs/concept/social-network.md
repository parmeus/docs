# Social Network

Parmeus social network uses decentralized identity and soulbound tokens to create similarity and connection-based networks. 

## Similarity Based Network
In the Parmeus ecosystem formed by Digital Souls, there is a virtual social graph constructed through the invisible relationships of soul similarity. In this social graph users can instantly find people who are similar to themselves. 

The Parmeus App currently has a search prototype. Through the sharing of video, music, food, and even tasks and activities in the web3 community, a brand-new search solution is provided, allowing users to find more human-centered and more suitable answers from people who are similar to themselves. [Try it out](https://demo.parmeus.com/lifeSearch?category=web3_task).

## Connection Based Network
With the similarity based network, Parmeus allows users to better discover each other; it also provides a set of tools to establish a long-term relationship with other digital souls in a decentralized manner.
