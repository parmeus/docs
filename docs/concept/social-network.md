# Social Network

Parmeus Social Network consists of similarity and connection based networks.

## Similarity Based Network
In the ecology formed by Digital Souls, there is a virtual social graph constructed through the invisible relationship of similarity. In this social graph, users can easily find people who are similar to themselves; through purposeful searches, they can consult solutions to people who are similar to themselves, and find solutions that are more suitable for them.

In the Parmeus App, we briefly completed a search prototype. Through the sharing of video, music, food, and even tasks and activities in the Web 3 world by users in the community, a brand-new search solution is provided to find more humane and more suitable answers from people who are similar to themselves.

## Connection Based Network
With the similarity based network, Parmeus allows users to better discover each other; it also provides a set of tools to establish a long-term relationship with other digital souls in a decentralized manner.
