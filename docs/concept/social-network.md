# Social Network

Parmeus creates a social network through the use of decentralized identity and Soulbound tokens. Each user in the Parmeus ecosystem has a unique digital ID contained in a Soulbound token that is connected to one or more web3 wallet addresses.

Through the Parmeus ID and connected Soulbound token, each Digital Self represents th the user's achievements, characteristics, traits, and unique information. The network connects users with others who have similar interests and traits, creating a virtual social graph through the invisible relationships of soul similarity. 

## Similarity Based Network
This creates a comprehensive and representative layer of data about individuals and their behavior and social relationships. Through this layer of data, Parmeus creates a similarity-based network where users can find people who are similar to themselves instantly.

By forming a network based on similarities, Parmeus creates a space where users can connect and collaborate with other like-minded individuals, forming long-term relationships in a decentralized manner.

## Connection Based Network

Connection-based networks allow users to explore and expand on the structure of existing social relationships within the Parmeus network and grow their social capital across specific subsections of the network that are most relevant to them.

Through these connection-based networks, users can build social capital and expand their professional and personal networks in a way that aligns with their interests, values, and goals. This creates opportunities for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and community building, all while retaining control over personal data and identity.

## Social Search

In addition to its similarity-based and connection-based networks, Parmeus also offers a unique social search experience that leverages verifiable social signals. These signals are derived the data connected with a user's Soulbound token, which represent their interests, achievements, and other innate characteristics.

The Parmeus App currently has a search prototype. Through the sharing of video, music, food, and even tasks and activities in the web3 community, a brand-new search solution is provided, allowing users to find more human-centered and more suitable answers from people who are similar to them.

With these verifiable social signals, Parmeus users can easily search for and discover others who share similar interests or traits. For example, users can search for other Digital Souls who have earned a specific type of digital asset, indicating a particular area of expertise or achievement. This can be particularly useful for networking, recruiting, or seeking advice on a particular topic.

As the Parmeus ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, the potential applications for social search and verifiable social signals are virtually limitless. Whether for personal or professional networking, finding like-minded individuals, or discovering new opportunities, Parmeus offers a unique and powerful toolset for connecting with others in the web3 space.
