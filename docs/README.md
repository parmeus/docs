# Overview

## Introduction

Parmeus is a decentralized network for users to create, grow, and own their digital selves. We define a Digital Soul as a collection of traits across domains of personality, non-cognitive qualities, and preferences, forming a unique digital identity. With such a rich digital representation of who we are, the network generates value by encouraging its participants - individuals and organizations - to contribute and gain information about themselves and others, and matching them with each other as appropriate.

Parmeus also describes a data storage standard - a soulbound identity - as the foundation of a seamless and secure digital social experience in web3.

Parmeus users can build their digital souls through a selection of mini-games, share their experiences and knowledge across their social network, and earn rewards as part of their network activity.

## The Essence of Parmeus

### Computationally efficient

Parmeus has a long-term, persistent, and continuously optimized AI computing model that continuously collects players' performance in the game, and then abstracts these behavioral data into a digital soul model that users continuously build. The digital soul will be safely and properly indexed into a similarity-based social graph. Therefore, Parmeus can perform similar person search and correlation analysis in the graph very efficiently.

### Interpretable

Parmeus has designed an intuitive digital soul system based on decades of business experience in behavioral science and economics, which supports the entire system. It provides a solid foundation for multi-class upper-layer applications, such as Soulbound tokens, querying similar groups under specific conditions, recommendation ability, etc.

### Efficient on-chain storage

The unique digital soul of Parmeus is designed and stored as a non-transferrable NFT. Every user owns and controls their own digital ID, and the NFTs that make up a digital soul. As the user continues to develop their digital soul, we seamlessly and continuously process the data and securely store it in a decentralized database.

### Flexible level of access

Parmeus securely encrypts the user's digital soul, and ensures users can access it in a way that they can control. A digital soul can be divided into public data, social data, and private data. Customizable access rules allow the user to fine-tune access to, and monetization of, their data according to their own needs.
