# Overview

## Introduction

Parmeus is a social capital ecosystem built on the concept of Digital Selves, which are privacy-focused digital identification methods that connect the collection of traits across domains of personality, non-cognitive qualities, and preferences to form a unique digital identity. This is achieved by linking a web3 wallet to a Parmeus Soulbound Token, along with all layers of data that create a unique digital representation of that person.

The Digital Self serves as the foundation for individuals to build up their online identities and social capital. Through Parmeus, users can create, develop, and control their digital identities, which are based on representative psychological and economic models. This empowers stronger, more meaningful, and personalized connections that are built on more complex digital representations of people.

Parmeus is also built to be interoperable, creating opportunities for both users and developers to create more value in ways that benefit users, app developers, and the wider digital ecosystem. By offering a privacy-focused and transparent way for users to build their digital selves, Parmeus represents a significant step towards creating a more open and equitable digital landscape for users to connect, build and grow their social capital.

The network generates value by connecting individuals and organizations based on what matters most to them. With a rich digital representation of users' traits, behavior, and preferences, Parmeus encourages its participants to contribute and gain information about themselves and others, and matches them with each other as appropriate. By doing so, Parmeus creates new relationships and communities based on shared interests and values.

## A Digital Self

In the Parmeus network, a Digital Self is an individual's unique digital identity that is created, nurtured, grown, owned, and shared by the user. The user's Digital Self is linked to a derived layer of data that represents the user's innate characteristics, skills, and preferences. All information related to a Digital Self is stored anonymously using secure and robust decentralized file storage. A Soulbound Token is used to connect each user's derived data layers to Parmeus Discovery Protocol and dApps.

## Web3 Social Capital

Parmeus provides users with complete control over their participation in the network, including their level of interaction with others and how they choose to build their social capital and participate in the economic components of the network. This gives users the power to shape their digital identities and build their social capital on their own terms.

Deploying social capital can be a powerful way for users to build and enhance their online identities and achieve their goals. By leveraging a rich digital representation of users' traits, behavior, and preferences, users can connect with others who share their interests and values, building meaningful relationships and communities across different web3 ecosystems. Social capital can be deployed to create new opportunities, whether it's finding a new job, investing in a promising project, or collaborating on a new venture.

By leveraging a more nuanced and meaningful representation of individuals, web3 ecosystems can create new opportunities for individuals, groups and decentralized organizations to connect and collaborate. Deploying social capital across web3 can lead to a more diverse, vibrant, and inclusive digital ecosystem that empowers individuals and fosters innovation.

## Parmeus Network Properties

### Representative

Parmeus creates a deep and multifaceted representation of the user's innate personal traits, which provides highly customized and relevant social experiences for the user. The network measures a range of personal traits that represent the multifaceted nature of a person's psychology, covering a wide spectrum of individual differences in cognitive and non-cognitive abilities.

### Generalizable

Parmeus's derived data is highly generalizable, based on findings from decades of psychological and behavioral economics research. The data derived from the user's raw data is relevant and useful beyond the contexts from which it was collected, and its utility can immediately be realized for novel applications. This means that experiences with Parmeus can be highly customized for users with no on-chain web3 history, and even for users with little or no available historical web2 data.

### Computationally efficient

Parmeus's protocol is computationally efficient, with a long-term, persistent, and optimized AI computing model that continuously improves and refines users' derived data from a comprehensive range of raw data. The protocol uses a comprehensive store of raw data to generate a layer of derived data, with only a single score or a handful of scores needing to be accessed from a user's Parmeus ID. This ensures that the protocol is efficient and cost-effective.

### Privacy preserving

Parmeus uses secure transactions, communication, and data storage, and keeps all personal data and Personal Identifying Information (PII) confidential. All user data is secured, and users have control over how their data is used and shared. The use of Soulbound Token NFTs means that user data is handled in a completely transparent way, giving users complete control over their own data and digital identity.

### Interoperable

Parmeus's protocol is chain agnostic and can operate across different chains, as well as applications across different chains. The protocol uses highly abstract ways of representing data, which can be used with any platform, enabling cross-chain interoperability for Parmeus SBTs.

### Interpretable

Parmeus provides metrics from the derived data layer that are intuitive and easy for users to understand. The protocol reports meaningful behaviors, preferences, and traits, providing a solid foundation for multi-class upper-layer applications, querying similar groups under specific conditions, recommendation ability, and more. This makes the derived data layer more efficient for storage and retrieval.

### Cost-effective on- and off-chain storage

Parmeus uses a single on-chain, non-transferable NFT (Soulbound Token) to connect off-chain storage of a user's data with on-chain identity, which is the most cost-effective way of enabling users to have control over their own data while maintaining computational efficiency. The derived data layer ensures that retrieval of a user's relevant data is both efficient and cost-effective, with raw data stored securely off-chain and Parmeus continuously processing the data to ensure the derived data layer is the most accurate comprehensive representation of an individual's traits and preferences.
