# Overview

## Introduction

Parmeus is a decentralized network for users to create, grow and own their digital selves. We
define digital self as a personâ€™s soulbound traits across domains of personality, non-cognitive
qualities and preferences. With such a rich digital representation of who we are, the network
generates value by encouraging and matching its participants, individuals or organizations, to
contribute and gain information about themselves and others.

Parmeus also describes a data standard, storage, soulbound identity as the foundation of a seamless and secure digital social experience in Web3.

In Parmeus world, user could build digital-soul during game playing; with digial-soul, user could share life experience, knowledge to social and earn.

## The Essence of Parmeus

### Computationally efficient

Parmeus has a long-term, persistent, and continuously optimized AI computing model that continuously collects players' performance in the game, and then abstracts these behavioral data into a digital soul model that users continuously build. The digital soul will be safely and properly indexed into a similarity-based social graph. Therefore, Parmeus can perform similar person search and correlation analysis in the graph very efficiently.

### Interpretable

Parmeus has designed an explanatory digital soul system based on decades of business experience in behavioral science and economics, supporting the entire system. It provides a solid foundation for multi-class upper-layer applications. Such as Soulbound Token, query similar groups under specific conditions, and recommendation ability, etc.

### Efficient on-chain storage

The unique digital soul of Parmeus is designed and stored in a flexible mutable NFT manner. We uphold the spirit of Web3 and return the digital soul model to users. As users continue to train digital soul, we also seamlessly and continuously process the data and properly store it in a decentralized database.

### Flexible level of access

Parmeus properly encrypts the user's digital soul. Ensure that users can access in a way that they can control. Digital soul can be divided into public data, relatives/friends data and private data. Users can customize their own access rules for digital soul in the process of sharing and earning according to their own needs.
