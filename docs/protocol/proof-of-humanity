### Proof of Humanity

Parmeus Protocol includes a Proof of Humanity feature, which verifies that a specific wallet or account is controlled and used by a real person with live on-chain verification. This is a critical feature that prevents bot activity and provides real-time verification for any on-chain activity that requires an account connected with a real person. Parmeus achieves this in a secure and privacy-preserving way.

Parmeus network uses game-based general intelligence checks and sanity metrics to build a robust and scalable personhood check. This ensures that users of Parmeus Protocol are real people and not bots.
