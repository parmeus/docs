# Proof of Identity

To maintain the integrity and security of the network, Parmeus requires each user to verify their identity using web3 wallets such as Metamask or Trust Wallet. This ensures that every participant in the network is linked to a real-world identity, preventing bots, fake accounts, and other fraudulent activity.

By integrating multiple verification methods, Parmeus creates a robust and secure Proof of Identity system that ensures the integrity and authenticity of the network, while also protecting user privacy and data.
