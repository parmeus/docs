# Proof of Connection

Parmeus "Proof of Connection" is a unique feature that verifies a user's social relationship with other users within the network. By using verifiable social signals, Proof of Connection creates a mechanism to ensure that relationships within the network are genuine and real.

Proof of Connection is created by utilizing the trust network within the Parmeus ecosystem. The trust network is established through a system of verifiable credentials. By leveraging the trust network and verifiable credentials, Parmeus can ensure that relationships are not based on fake profiles or bots, and that users are interacting with genuine and trustworthy individuals. Proof of Connection is an essential feature for building a robust and scalable social network, where users can connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals, and create meaningful relationships within the digital world.
