Parmeus is an ecological system formed by digital souls. Here, end-users can play, train their digital souls, and earn badges. Parmeus also defines a series of protocols for developers to provide recommendations, identity authentication and other functions on various projects. Welcome to the Parmeus ecosystem, we are here to help you succeed.
