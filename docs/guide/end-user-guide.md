# End-User Guide

Parmeus provides a built-in game world which allows users to create and develop their Digital Souls. Please follow this step-by-step instruction to kick-off this Digital Soul building journey.

## Setup a Wallet
To enter the web3 world, you need a wallet. `MetaMask` is the most popular digital wallet specific to Ethereum. Parmeus supports a few other wallets as well, and more to come.

In this guide, we will use MetaMask as an example to show you how to set up a wallet.

* Download and install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/download/) through their website.
* Select `Create a Wallet`.
* Provide a username and password, and store them securely.
* Pay close attention to your uniquely assigned Secret Recovery Phrase, and store it somewhere safe. If you lose this series of words or forget what order theyâ€™re in, you will lose access to your wallet and it will be unrecoverable. We recommend writing the phrase in a secret notebook.
* Confirm the phrase by placing all of the words in the correct order as they were assigned.
* Now, MetaMask is setup and should appear in your browser extensions.

## Switch Network in Wallet

Parmeus supports Ethereum only currently. Make sure the active network is `Ethereum Mainnet`. You can switch networks by opening MetaMask and clicking at the top of the MetaMask extension. You'll see your current network displayed, click on it and you can select any network from the drop-down list.
