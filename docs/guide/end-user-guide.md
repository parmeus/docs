# End-User Guide

Parmeus provides a built-in game world where allows users to initialize digital souls. Please follow this step-by-step instruction to kick-off this digital soul building journey.

## Setup a Wallet
To enter the web3 world, you need a wallet. `MetaMask` is the most popular digital wallet specific to Ethereum. Parmeus supports a few other wallets as well, and more to come.

In this guide, we will take `MetaMask` as an example to guide you to setup wallet.

* Download and install the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/download/) through their website.
* Select `Create a Wallet`.
* Provide a `username` and `password` and saftly keep it.
* Pay close attention to your uniquely assigned `Secret Recovery Phrase`, and store it somewhere safe. If you lose this series of words or forget what order theyâ€™re in, you will lose access to your wallet and it will be unrecoverable. We recommend to write the phrase on your secrete notebook.
* Confirm the phrase by placing all of the words in the correct order as they were assigned.
* Now, MetaMask is setup and should appear in your browser extensions.

## Switch Network in Wallet

Parmeus supports Ethereum only currently. Make sure the active network is `Ethereum Mainnet`. You can switch networks by opening MetaMask and clicking at the top of the MetaMask extension. You'll see your current network displayed, click on it and you can select any network from the drop-down list.
